# Build Guide


## I 
Get the parts. Here's the [BOM](https://github.com/attowatt/i2c2midi#BOM).

## II
Solder the following parts:

- Resistors (R1, R2, R3, R4, R5)

- Voltage regulator: Bend the legs before soldering.
- Power header: Please check the orientation â€“ the opening of the header should be on the right, when -12V is on the bottom.

- Diodes: Orientation does not matter.

- I2C header
- Teensy header: I prefer to solder a few pins with the Teensy board attached (to make sure it will fit later), then remove the Teensy and solder the rest of the pins.

Cut the legs of the parts.


## III
- Mount the spacer to the PCB with one of the two M3 screws.
- Place the stereo jack (U1) and leds into their positions, but don't solder them yet.
- Place the panel on top of the stereo jack and spacer. Mount it to the jack with the nut and to the spacer with the second M3 screw.

## IV
- Carefully place the LEDs into position, so they look nice on the panel. Then solder them.
- Solder the stereo jack.

## V
- Connect the Teensy to your computer with a USB cable.
- Download the firmware and open it with [Teensyduino](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_download.html)
- Under `Tools`, set `Board` to `Teensy 3.2`, `USB Type` to `Serial`, and select the `Port` that shows the Teensy.
- Upload the firmware to your Teensy. 
- If the upload was successfull, i2c2midi lights up with both LEDs turning on and off four times.
